# Enhanced Knowledge Graph Query System

## Overview

The enhanced `kg_query.py` system now integrates **news articles with sentiment analysis** alongside the existing 10-K financial data, providing comprehensive strategic analysis that combines:

- **Financial metrics** from SEC filings
- **Market sentiment** from news articles  
- **Timeline correlation** between events and market reactions
- **Cross-domain entity linking** between financial and news data
- **Sentiment-aware strategic insights**

## New Capabilities

### 1. News Article Integration

The system now retrieves and analyzes news articles that mention the organization, providing:

- **Content matching**: Articles relevant to the query topic
- **Sentiment analysis**: VADER sentiment scores (positive/negative/neutral)
- **Publisher information**: Source attribution and credibility context
- **Entity extraction**: People, organizations, and concepts mentioned
- **Financial concept linking**: Connections to 10-K filing concepts

### 2. Sentiment Timeline Analysis

Track market sentiment around key financial events:

- **Filing correlation**: News sentiment within Â±60 days of SEC filings
- **Event reaction analysis**: How market sentiment changed after earnings/announcements
- **Temporal patterns**: Sentiment trends over time periods
- **Market timing**: Pre/post filing sentiment shifts

### 3. Enhanced Context Building

The query system now provides enriched context with:

```
<<NEWS SENTIMENT SUMMARY (Last 90 Days)>>
- Total articles: 45
- Average sentiment: 0.127 (Positive)
- Distribution: 18 positive, 12 negative, 15 neutral

<<RECENT NEWS ARTICLES WITH SENTIMENT>>
- 2024-01-15 [Reuters]: IBM beats Q4 earnings expectations... [Sentiment: positive (0.34)] [Financial: revenue, earnings]

<<NEWS SENTIMENT AROUND FILING DATES>>
- 10-K filing 2024-02-28 â†’ 2024-03-02 (2 days after): IBM reports strong cloud growth... [Sentiment: positive (0.41)]
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Enhanced Query

```bash
python kg_query.py --prompt "IBM financial performance and market sentiment analysis" --show-context
```

```

### 3. Timeline Analysis

```python
"Show me the sentiment timeline around IBM's major announcements in 2024"
"How did news coverage change before and after IBM's strategy shift?"
```

### 4. Competitive Intelligence

```python
"Compare market sentiment between IBM and its competitors"
"What are the market concerns about IBM's competitive position?"
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Neo4j Configuration (same as before)
export NEO4J_URI=bolt://localhost:7687
export NEO4J_USER=neo4j
export NEO4J_PASSWORD=neo4j_password
export NEO4J_DB=neo4j

# LLM Configuration (same as before)
export LLM_BACKEND=ollama
export OLLAMA_MODEL=gpt-oss:20b
```

### Prerequisites

1. **10-K Data**: Existing financial filing data from `ingest_10k_to_neo4j.py`
2. **News Data**: News articles ingested via `ingest_news_to_neo4j.py`
3. **Neo4j Indexes**: Both `sentenceText` and `articleContent` fulltext indexes

## Testing

Run the test script to verify enhanced functionality:

```bash
python test_enhanced_query.py
```

This will test:
- Organization resolution
- News context retrieval  
- Sentiment analysis integration
- Comprehensive context building
- Cross-domain entity linking

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No News Data Found**
   ```
   Ensure news ingestion completed: python ingest_news_to_neo4j.py
   Check date ranges and organization linking
   ```

2. **Missing Sentiment Scores**
   ```
   Verify sentiment analysis ran during news ingestion
   Check Sentiment node creation in Neo4j
   ```

3. **Poor Context Quality**
   ```
   Adjust query parameters (k value) for more/less context
   Verify fulltext indexes are created and populated
   ```

### Performance Optimization

1. **Large News Datasets**
   - Adjust time windows for sentiment analysis
   - Use date-based filtering for recent articles only
   - Optimize Neo4j memory settings

2. **Query Response Time**
   - Reduce context size (k parameter) for faster responses
   - Use more specific queries to improve relevance
   - Consider parallel processing for multiple organizations
